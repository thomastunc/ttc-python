    "This part is about defining variables based on the values of other variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could define a variable *exactly* like another variable, as in:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> a = 10\n",
    "> b = a\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "And we could define a variable based on some expression in which another variable appears, as in:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> c = 2 * a\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, all is clear and simple:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> print(a)\n",
    "> print(b)\n",
    "> print(c)\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```commandline\n",
    "> 10\n",
    "> 10\n",
    "> 20\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "But now we change the original object `a`:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> a *= 2\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can wonder: do the values of `b` and `c` change along with `a`? *What do you expect?* \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's print the variables again.\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> print(a)\n",
    "> print(b)\n",
    "> print(c)\n",
    "> ```\n",

    "> ```commandline\n",
    "> 20\n",
    "> 10\n",
    "> 20\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** the variables `b` and `c` do not change when we change `a`, even though they were originally defined based on the value of `a`. There is no *continuous link* between *these* variables...\n",
    "\n",
    "**But beware:** this is not the case for all data types! The above conclusion is `True`only for **non-mutable** data types, but not for **mutable** data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the data types we have worked with so far, and distinguish them based on mutability:\n",

    "- **Mutable data types:** `list, dict`\n",
    "\n",
    "And now let's look at an example for `a, b, c` when they were lists:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> a = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "> b = a\n",
    "> c = [:2]\n",

    "> This is a: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "> This is b: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "> This is c: [1, 2]\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that `b` shows the same as `a`: this is because `a` and `b` are different names for **the same object** (the same list). The assignment `b = a` simply gives us a second name `b` for the object that `a` was already referring to. They are both *pointing at* the same list! On the other hand, when we define `c = [:2]`, we create a new list based on an operation on the original list (list slicing). \n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the first example, when dealing with integers:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> a = 10\n",
    "> b = a\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "You could ask: but don't `a` and `b` point at *the same* object `10` here? And the answer is simple: they do **not**, because it is a immutable object. Whenever we perform an operation on an immutable object - this includes the assignment operation `b = a` - we create a new object.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Assignment 15.1\n",

    "\n",
    "Call this function 10 times (with different numbers).\n",

In the error report, you would then see an overview of both exceptions, since the second exception appears in the `try-except` block of the first exception: the one raised in `func_a()`, that this was handled in `func_b()` but that during the exception handling another exception was thrown...\n",

    "\n",
    "A common guideline is that a single function has a single, well-defined task. If a function does many different things, it is better to divide these tasks into separate functions and have another function execute the sequence of these functions. We can make a rough division of functions into two types this way: a function that performs some calculation or computation, and a function that executes (and manages) some process. The latter type is a higher level in the program hierarchy: it may call many calculations and perform some complex task based on the combination of those. Do note that we still consider this function to execute a single task, even if it envolves multiple substeps, the task being defined as *perform complex process `x`*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this design pattern, it is a good practice to have calculation functions not handle their own exceptions, but have the management-type functions handle the exceptions. It should also be noted that the management-type function should not have to get involved with all the mathematical/computational details of the functions it calls, so the exception handling should be possible at a simple, process-management level.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are 2 well-defined naming styles which revolve around the usage of lower/uppercase letters, which you should use in Python: `camel case`, like 'sumOfCosts' or 'internationalStudent', and `snake case`, like 'sum_of_costs or 'international_student'. For camel cuse, you write words directly adjacent to each other, using uppercase for every word after the first. For snake case, you separate words with '_' and only use lowercase. There are different types of objects that, according to PEP8, should be written with a specific case style (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some guidelines:\n",
    "- Give exact names to your variables. `a` is not as clear as `number` is not as clear as `sum` is not as clear `sum_of_costs`, if you are writing a program that processes several costs and calculates their sum.\n",
    "- Use snake case for names of functions and variables. User uppercase words only for (global) constants. *Note: there are other naming conventions for different types of objects that are not seen in this course. So snake case is the way to go for (almost) all that we do in this course!\n",

It's not a number like *a count of chickens in a field*, which should really be an int and be *ultimately precise* (one cannot count 2.6 chickens).
