    "This part is about defining variables based on the values of other variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could define a variable *exactly* like another variable, as in:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> a = 10\n",
    "> b = a\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "And we could define a variable based on some expression in which another variable appears, as in:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> c = 2 * a\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, all is clear and simple:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> print(a)\n",
    "> print(b)\n",
    "> print(c)\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```commandline\n",
    "> 10\n",
    "> 10\n",
    "> 20\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "But now we change the original object `a`:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> a *= 2\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can wonder: do the values of `b` and `c` change along with `a`? *What do you expect?* \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's print the variables again.\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> print(a)\n",
    "> print(b)\n",

    "> 20\n",
    "> 10\n",
    "> 20\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** the variables `b` and `c` do not change when we change `a`, even though they were originally defined based on the value of `a`. There is no *continuous link* between *these* variables...\n",
    "\n",
    "**But beware:** this is not the case for all data types! The above conclusion is `True`only for **non-mutable** data types, but not for **mutable** data types.\n",

    "Let's look at the data types we have worked with so far, and distinguish them based on mutability:\n",

    "- **Mutable data types:** `list, dict`\n",

    "And now let's look at an example for `a, b, c` when they were lists:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> a = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "> b = a\n",
    "> c = [:2]\n",

    "> This is b: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "> This is c: [1, 2]\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that `b` shows the same as `a`: this is because `a` and `b` are different names for **the same object** (the same list). The assignment `b = a` simply gives us a second name `b` for the object that `a` was already referring to. They are both *pointing at* the same list! On the other hand, when we define `c = [:2]`, we create a new list based on an operation on the original list (list slicing). \n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the first example, when dealing with integers:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> a = 10\n",
    "> b = a\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "You could ask: but don't `a` and `b` point at *the same* object `10` here? And the answer is simple: they do **not**, because it is a immutable object. Whenever we perform an operation on an immutable object - this includes the assignment operation `b = a` - we create a new object.\n",

    "\n",
    "Call this function 10 times (with different numbers).\n",
