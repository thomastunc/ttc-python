    "- Float\n",
    "- Boolean\n",
    "- String\n",

    "- A list that keeps track of your transactions today\n",

    "\n",
    "You now understand the basics of creating a list and how to retrieve individual items from a list. There are also a number of useful tools you can use with lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "**len()**\n",
    "With the function `len()` you can get how many items there are in a list. You use it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> groceries = [\"butter\", \"cheese\", \"eggs\"]\n",
    "> quantity = len(groceries)\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable 'quantity' is now equal to 3. You can now print this variable, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "**.append()**\n",
    "With the subfunction `.append()` you can add additional items to your list in the code, always at the end. Very useful if you want to give the user the option to add something while executing your code. You use it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> groceries = [\"butter\", \"cheese\", \"eggs\"]\n",
    "> groceries.append(\"milk\")\n",
    "> print(groceries)\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "The list now contains 4 items and the last item is now 'milk'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "> ```commandline\n",
    "> [\"butter\", \"cheese\", \"eggs\", \"milk\"]\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "**.insert()**\n",
    "With the subfunction `.insert()` you can add additional items to your list in the code, at a specified position (index). It gives more control then **append**, in case you need it. You use it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> groceries = [\"butter\", \"cheese\", \"eggs\"]\n",
    "> groceries.insert(1, \"milk\")\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "The list now contains 4 items and the second item is now 'milk'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "> ```commandline\n",
    "> [\"butter\", \"milk\", \"cheese\", \"eggs\"]\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "**.remove()**\n",
    "You can also remove items from your list with the `.remove()` subfunction. This looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> groceries = [\"butter\", \"cheese\", \"eggs\"]\n",
    "> groceries.remove(\"eggs\")\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "You are now left with a list with 2 items and the last item is now 'cheese'.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "**.pop()**\n",
    "Another way to delete an item is with `.pop()`. The big difference is that you provide an index instead of an item. So for example, if you want to remove the first item from the list, you select position 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice: the value of the pop expression contains the value you take out of the list: the pop operation looks like taking something out of a list and thereby holding it in hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> groceries = [\"butter\", \"cheese\", \"eggs\"]\n",
    "> eaten_product = groceries.pop(0)\n",
    "> print(eaten_product)\n",
    "> print(groceries)\n",

    "> ```commandline\n",
    "> butter\n",
    "> [\"cheese\", \"eggs\"]\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you also have a list of 2 items, but it only consists of cheese and eggs. Butter has been removed because it is in position 0.\n",
    "Note: you do not need to store the removed value, you can simply call the pop command.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "**len()**\n",
    "You can ask a list how many items it contains with the len function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> groceries = [\"butter\", \"cheese\", \"eggs\"]\n",

    "> 3\n",

    "----\n",

    "In Python, you are free to use single and double quote characters to define a string object, as long as the start and end are the same.\n",
    "There is no single correct definition. The only instruction you are given as programmer is **to be consistent**. For simple/short str objects, convention is to use single quotes:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> some_str = 'hello'\n",
    "> another_str = '5'\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can encounter a problem if we want to have a quote character stored in string:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> quote_character = '''\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above program crashes, because it runs into a problem that Python syntax has rules for processing the quote characters in pairs. The first two quote characters form a pair: they create the empty string `''`. The third quote character is the start of a new string, but it is never paired with a fourth quote character, so Python cannot make sense of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are ways to solve this problem: one is by using the quote characters we want *inside* the str, and the other possible quote characters to define the str itself:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> single_quote_character = \"'\"\n",
    "> double_quote_character = '\"'\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this to process quotes inside a cool story you're writing in a Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> a_good_question = \"My friend once asked me: 'how is it that we're supposed to deal with quotes?'\"\n",
    "> a_possible_answer = '\"You can deal with them in several ways\" I responded wisely'\n",
    "> does_not_work = 'And the fool said:'You can also try it like this!\"\" \n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "The outer quote simbles define the total string object, within which a new pair of quote symbols is defined. The variable `does_not_work` cannot be created (the program will crash), because the single and double quote pairs exist *next to each other* instead of *one within the other*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Escape characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to solve *the quote problem* is using escape characters, with which we can force Python to use a character in a specific way:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> use_escape_character = '\\''\n",
    "> print(use_escape_character)\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```commandline\n",
    "> '\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the backslash itself is not part of the string, it is interpreted by Python as an instruction to `use the next character as-is`. It will, thus, not use the next quote character as a way of closing a string object, but simply as a character *inside a str*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are two other important usages of escape characters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> the_double_escape = '\\\\'\n",

    "> \\\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Hello\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the escape character on itself for `the_double_escape` means we force Python to give us the actual character (once) in the str object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `\\n` is the definition of the **newline**: *going to the next line, just like pressing Enter*... (notice the empty line between \\ and Hello)\n",
